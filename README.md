ATS RESUME SCORER 

The main logic used for this is in the file resume.py 

the other two folders are essentially the backend(django) and the frontend(react) of a website that would be an ats scorer 

I am currently in the process of launching it as a website, just looking into how i should launch it, and working on the style and especially on some new features to be added. 

http://13.39.135.220 here is the public ip if u wanna access it (ill add some nice style later)
